Christine, oh Christine,
My heart sings for thee
With each passing day,
My love grows endlessly.

Your eyes, a glimpse of heaven
Your smile, a ray of sunshine
In your presence, my soul finds solace
In your embrace, my heart finds home.

My love for you is boundless
As infinite as the stars above
Christine, oh Christine,
You are my one true love. """
